            We guarantee our industry leading turnaround of 15 business days or
            your money back. The vast majority of custom embroidered patch
            orders ship well before our 15 business day deadline. If you are
            behind schedule, our Rush Turnaround option adds 50% to the unit
            price and will move your order to a dedicated facility where we can
            guarantee a 10 business day turnaround.

            We conveniently allow you to split a woven label order into
            different size symbol versions (ex. S, M, L, XL) or color versions.
            Simply select the number of versions needed and include instructions
            with how many of each version in the comment section of your order.
            Our art department can help add the size symbols or colors to your
            artwork if needed and you will be able to verify everything looks
            correct on your digital proof before production begins.
